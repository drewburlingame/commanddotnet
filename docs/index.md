# Introduction

***Model your command line application interface in a class***

The purpose of this **framework** is to let developers focus on the core logic of command line application by defining commands with methods and arguments with parameters. 

*Out-of-the-box* support for help documentation, subcommmands, dependency injection, validation, piping, prompting, passwords, response files and more. 

Includes [test tools](test-tools.md) used by the framework to test all features of the framework.

Modify and extend the functionality of the framework through configuration and middleware.
